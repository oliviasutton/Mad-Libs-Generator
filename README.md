It was about 3 hours ago when I came to the hospital in a unicycle. The hospital is a/an warm place, there are a lot of stinky cars here. There are nurses here who have purple toes. If someone wants to come into my room I told them that they have to run first. I have decorated my room with 9 cats. Today a doctor came into my room and they were wearing a fridge on their arm. I heard that all doctors sleep chairs every day for breakfast. The cold thing about being in the hospital is the goober flower!
